					<p><span lang="zh-Hans">嗨</span>！I am Cathy. I chatted with David this week, and he told me about the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia in China. What an awesome place! Intrigued by the information, I also did my research of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and it's such a beautiful place with so much to offer! Let me share with you some information I've researched for the region. Have fun!</p>

							<li>Inner Mongolia has temperate monsoon climate. It has very little and uneven raindrops. </li>
							<li>It has long and cold winters, lasting for five to six months. It has short and hot summers, lasting for a month or two. Its springs are windy and dry, while its falls have drastic temperature drops.</li>
							<li>The herdsmen in Inner Mongolia move around on the prairie with their herd all year around. They live in portable tents called <span lang="zh-Hans">蒙古包</span> ménggǔbāo (yurts), which can be built and unbuilt quickly and easily. Inside a yurt, it's cool in the summer and warm in the winter, thanks to its domed shape. Its design can also cope with harsh weather conditions like snowstorms.</li>

Some are made of silk or cotton. Mongolian gowns are usually loose with long sleeves and mostly in red, yellow, or deep blue. People also wear belts made of red or green silk. They also wear boots, hats, and jewelry. </li>
							<li><strong>Food</strong>: The Mongolian people use simply cooking methods such as roasting to keep the original flavors of the ingredients. Sometimes they also stew or steam the food. The main ingredients of their everyday diet are beef, mutton, dairy products, and flour-based food. Mongolian dishes may not be well-decorated but are flavorful and fulfilling. A well-known Mongolian meal is <span lang="zh-Hans">烤全羊</span> Kǎoquányáng (roasted whole lamb). It is commonly served at banquets or celebrations.</li>

		<h2><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h2>
		<p>Now let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>

		<div class="fev_grammer_div">
			<h3>Conditions with "<span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào" and "<span lang="zh-Hans">就</span> jiù" to express "if…then…"</h3>

			<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào + verb +  <span
						lang="zh-Hans">就</span> jiù + verb</strong> to express "if…then."</p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this lesson. Just focus on the grammar points you are learning.</p>

			<p><strong>For example</strong>: </p>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">你<strong>要</strong>去<strong>就</strong>快一点</span>。<span lang="zh-Hans">暴风雪就要来了</span>。Nǐ <strong>yào</strong> qù <strong>jiù</strong> kuàiyīdiǎn. Bàofēngxuě jiùyǎo láile. (<strong>If</strong> you want to go, <strong>then</strong> hurry up. The blizzard is coming.)</p>


			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">你<strong>要</strong>研究这种岩石<strong>就</strong>应该去内蒙古</span>。Nǐ <strong>yào</strong> yánjiū zhèzhǒng yánshí <strong>jiù</strong> yīnggāi qù Nèiménggǔ. (<strong>If</strong> you want to study this type of rocks, <strong>then</strong> you should go to Inner Mongolia.)</p>



			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">我们<strong>要</strong>买煤炭<strong>就</strong>得去城市北边的那个市场</span>。Wǒmen <strong>yào</strong> mǎi méitàn <strong>jiù</strong> děi qù chéngshì běibiān de nàgè shìchǎng. (<strong>If</strong> we want to buy coal, <strong>then</strong> we need to go to the market in the north of the city.)</p>

		</div>






		<p>Let’s practice the grammar knowledge you just learned.</p>
