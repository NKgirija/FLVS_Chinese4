		<h2><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h2>
		<p>Now let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>

		<div class="fev_grammer_div">
			<h3>Expressing the only two possibilities "either…or" using "<span lang="zh-Hans">不是</span> bùshì…<span lang="zh-Hans">就是</span> jiùshì"</h3>

			<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">不是</span> bùshì + possibility 1 + <span lang="zh-Hans">就是 </span> 
				 jiùshì + possibility 2</strong> to express "either…or."</p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you will
				<strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this lesson. Just focus on the grammar points you are
				learning.
			</p>

			<p><strong>For example</strong>: </p>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">她戴的首饰<strong>不是</strong>金的<strong>就是</strong>银的</span>。Tā dài de shǒushì <strong>bùshì</strong> jīnde <strong>jiùshì</strong> yínde.(The jewelry she wears is <strong>either</strong> gold <strong>or</strong> silver.)
			</p>
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">这个夏天她<strong>不是</strong>去云南<strong>就是</strong>去福建</span>。Zhègè xiàtiān tā <strong>bùshī</strong> qù Yúnnán <strong>jiùshì</strong> qù Fújiàn. (This summer she <strong>either</strong> goes to Yunnan <strong>or</strong> to Fujian.)</p>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">今天晚上<strong>不是</strong>下雨<strong>就是</strong>下冰雹</span>。Jīntiān wǎnshàng <strong>bùshì</strong> xiàyǔ <strong>jiùshì</strong> xià bīngbáo. (This evening it'll <strong>either</strong> rain <strong>or</strong> hail.)</p>


		</div>

		<p>Let’s practice the grammar knowledge you just learned. </p>
