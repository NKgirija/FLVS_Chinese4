				<p><span lang="zh-Hans">你好</span>！It's David. Recently in my Chinese class at school, we are learning
					about the Fujian Province in southeastern China. Do you know that to say Fujian Province in Chinese,
					it's <a
					class="popover" data-position="top auto" data-title='<span lang="zh-Hans">福建省</span>'
					data-content='<span lang="zh-Hans">福建省</span> Fújiàn shěng (Fujian province) <audio controls src="media/fujian_province.mp3"></audio>'
					data-html="true" data-trigger="click"><span lang="zh-Hans">福建省</span></a>? We are
					learning about the geography in Fujian Province, and I've found some of the natural
					formations or phenomena there are similar to what we have in the United States. How amazing! Let me
					share some interesting compare and contrast characteristics of some similar natural wonders in the
					regions in China and those in the United States. Enjoy!</p>

		<h3><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h3>
		<p>Let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>

		<div class="tabs mt-3" data-position="left">
			<a class="tab" title="Expressing even if…still with 就算jiùsuàn">Expressing "even if…still" with "<span lang="zh-Hans">就算</span> jiùsuàn"</a>

			<div class="panel">
				<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">就算</span> jiùsuàn + situation, <span lang="zh-Hans">也</span> yě + action</strong> to express "even if…still."</p>


				<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
					will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this <span class="lang"
						data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. Just focus on the grammar points you are learning. </p>

				<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>就算</strong>那里有沼泽，他<strong>也</strong>要去探险</span>。<strong>Jiùsuàn </strong> nàlǐ yǒu zhǎozé, tā <strong>yě </strong> tào qù tànxiǎn. (<strong>Even if</strong> there are swamps there, he will <strong>still</strong> go on an adventure.)</p>

				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>就算</strong>搬到了热带地区，她<strong>也</strong>会穿很多衣服</span>。<strong> Jiùsuàn</strong> bāndào le rèdài dìqū, tā yě huì chuān hěnduō yīfu. (<strong>Even if</strong> moving to a tropical region, she will <strong>still</strong> wear a lot of clothes.)</p>
				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>就算</strong>明天有台风，我奶奶<strong>也</strong>不愿意离开这里</span>。<strong>Jiùsuàn</strong> míngtiān yǒu táifēng, wǒ nǎinai <strong>yě</strong> bùyuànyì līkái zhèlǐ. (<strong>Even if</strong> there's a typhoon tomorrow, my paternal grandma is <strong>still</strong> unwilling to leave here.)</p>

				<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">要是</span> yàoshì + situation, <span lang="zh-Hans">就</span> jiù + action</strong> to express "if…then."

				<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
