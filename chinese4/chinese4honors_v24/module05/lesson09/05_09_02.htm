                    <p>If you are not working consistently on the exam, your internet service provider may kick you
                        offline. This means you would lose all your work and have to start over. Your instructor will
                        have to reset the exam for you if this happens. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Stepping away or working inconsistently on the exam may kick you offline. If you lose all
                            your work and have to start over, be sure to contact your instructor for support with
                            resetting your exam. </li>
                        <li>You cannot open the exam, take your dog for a walk, and then come back. Leaving the exam,
                            even to complete it on paper, will count as a submission—even if there aren't any answers.
