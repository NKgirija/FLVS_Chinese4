        <p>Let's pretend that you are a member of a tourism company in China. Your first assignment for your job is to
          create a pamphlet advertising a region of China. Luckly for you, last week you were reviewing information
          about the Yunnan Province, the Fujian Province, and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. You will only have
          to pick one of the regions to highlight in your pamphlet. In your pamphlet, please include: 1) the region
          selected, 2) a description of the geography or weather from the region selected, and 3) a description of the
          culture or ethnic group from the region selected. Also 4) you can research online for information about this
          region to support your advertising, and you will provide the citation including the resource(s) you use for
          your research. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p> Use the "<a href="docs/ch4_05_05_regions_of_china_workshop_template.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn"
        role="button"><span class='lesson_name_tag'></span> Template</a>" for your work. You can also type your own
      portion of the
      pamphlet in Chinese using other formats. </p>


    <p>You can use the characters demonstrated in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> and/or
      any other characters you’ve learned previously. You can choose to type the characters directly into a word
      document, and then save the document as your work. </p>
