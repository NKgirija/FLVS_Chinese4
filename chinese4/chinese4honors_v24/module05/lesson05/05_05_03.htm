		<h1><span lang="zh-Hans">写汉字</span> Writing Chinese Characters</h1>

		<p>Before starting your actual writing, let’s look at the demonstration of how to write some new Chinese
			characters that you just learned, related to regions of China, stroke by stroke. You will use these
			characters and any others that you’ve previously learned for your writing later in this <span class="lang"
				data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.
		</p>


		<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also practice writing these characters, using <a
				href="docs/module_5_characters_stroke_sequence.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"
				class="fev_downloadbtn">
				<!-- <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download"></span> -->
				a printable worksheet</a>. This worksheet has <strong>areas for you to practice</strong> writing the
			characters, stroke
			by stroke. Feel free to print several copies for extra practice if you want. You can practice them on your
			own if you are interested. </p>
