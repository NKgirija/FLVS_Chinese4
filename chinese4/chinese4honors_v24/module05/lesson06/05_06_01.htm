                <p>You’ve done a fantastic job learning some important skills about regions of China! Now it’s time to put your verbal skills into action. Yes, we will have a conversation—in Chinese. You will have a discussion-based conversation with your instructor to showcase your learning.</p>

                <p>What do you need? When you contact your instructor, be sure to have a method to do a two-way audio/video exchange. What will you do or say? Easy—you'll show off your interpersonal and interpretive communication skills by engaging in an instructor-directed chat. And you have an opportunity to ask your instructor questions. Don't worry; you can take notes to use so you know what you want to say and ask and how to respond.</p>

        <p>During the conversation, your instructor may ask additional questions about the Chinese language and culture. These questions may be asked and answered verbally in English, especially when it involves the Chinese culture.</p>
