							<p>Last winter my friends and I went to Northeast China for a trip. Winters there were very cold. Each time I went out, I had to put on my boots and coat and wear my gloves and hat. There were many famous historic buildings in Northeast China, such as museums, churches, mosques, train stations, and so on, which were both ancient and beautiful. We also went skiing. Many people there were very good at skiing. Northeast China is truly a great place!</p>
