                    <p> The Three Northeast Provinces refer to the three provinces in Northeast China: <span lang="zh-Hans">黑龙江省</span> Hēilóngjiāng Shěng (Heilongjiang Province), <span lang="zh-Hans">吉林省</span> Jílín Shěng (Jilin Province), and <span lang="zh-Hans">辽宁省</span> Liáoníng Shěng (Liaoning Province). </p>
                        <p>The landscape in this region is mainly plains and mountains. It has fertile land and long rivers. It has up to 39.6% of forest cover rate and huge reserves of mineral resources, oil, and natural gas. This region is also the nation's main source of natural products, such as animal hides and herbal medicines. </p>
                        <p>Changbai Mountain (<span lang="zh-Hans">长白山</span> Chángbái Shān) region lays southwest to northeast along the north border of China. It has had volcano activities in the past, which produced fecund land for wild plants and animals to thrive. It has sixteen peaks exceeding 8,200 feet in elevation, which together are called <span lang="zh-Hans">长白十六峰</span> Chángbái Shíliù Fēng (The Sixteen Peaks of Changbai). </p>
                        <p>The landscape of the region earned its nickname <span lang="zh-Hans">白山黑水</span> Báishān hēishuǐ (White Mountains and Black Waters).</p>

                        <p>Most of The Three Northeast Provinces region has temperate monsoon climate. Winters there are long and cold, while summers are short and warm. It often snows in the winter, and it's always cold and humid in low lands. </p>
                        <p>Due to its abundant winter snowfalls, the region is famous for its winter sports, such as skiing, ice skating and sledding. Ice sculpturing is also huge in the region. </p>
                        <p>Each year, multiple ice and snow festivals are held in the region. One of the best known is Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival held in Harbin city, the capital of the Heilongjiang Province. This festival usually starts on January 5<sup>th</sup> each year and lasts for a whole month. During this festival, you get to see spectacular large-scale ice sculptures such as life-size ice palaces that you can walk around inside with plenty of space to spare.</p> 
                        <p>To cope with the harshly cold weather, people in Northeastern China build heatable earth beds (<span lang="zh-Hans">土炕</span> tǔkàng) in their houses. Such a bed has hollow structure underneath connecting to a stove, allowing heat to circulate when a fire is started in the stove, thus keeping the bed warm. </p>

A traditional Chinese feast combining cuisine from Manchu and Han ethnic groups, known as <span lang="zh-Hans">满汉全席</span> Mǎnhànquánxí (Manchu-Han Imperial Feast), includes 108 dishes from both ethnic groups and is expected to be consumed in three days.
