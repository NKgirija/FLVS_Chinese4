				<p><span lang="zh-Hans">嗨</span>！I am Cathy. Last Saturday I chatted with David, and he told me about his research on The Three Northeast Provinces region. He's found so much information on the geography, climate, ecosystem, and customs of the region. I was impressed! Among the information, the local food caught my eye. How I wanted to go there in person and try all these delicious dishes out! Let me share some of them with you! Enjoy the dishes, virtually! </p>

                        <ul><li>Fruits in hot toffee is a very popular dessert during meals in Northeastern China.</li> 
                            <li>Its main ingredients are various fruits and rock sugar. The most popular fruits used for this dish are apples and bananas. </li>
                            <li>To make this dish, you first clean and cut the fruit, then melt rock sugar in a pot/pan, and you continue to use low heat until the sugar becomes sticky. Now you coat the fruit pieces with the melted sugar, and let it cool down a bit. Remember to serve it in time so when a piece of fruit is pulled, you can see thin threads of liquid candy following along!</li>
                            <li>This dessert is crispy on the outside and fresh on the inside. It's also a great source of vitamin C!</li>

		<h2><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h2>
		<p>Now let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>


		<div class="fev_grammer_div">
			<h3>Expressing "the more... the more..." with "<span lang="zh-Hans">越</span> yuè...<span lang="zh-Hans">越</span> yuè..."</h3>
			<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">越</span> yuè ＋ verb ＋ <span lang="zh-Hans">越</span> yuè + adjective/verb</strong> to express "the more…the more." </p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
				will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this lesson. Just focus on the grammar
				points you are learning.</p>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">这本关于东三省的书他<strong>越</strong>读<strong>越</strong>觉得有趣。</span> Zhèběn guānyú Dōngsānshěng de shū tā <strong>yuè</strong> dú <strong>yuè</strong> juéde yǒuqù. (<strong>The more</strong> he reads this book on The Three Northeast Provinces, <strong>the more</strong> he finds it interesting.)</p>

<p><span lang="zh-Hans">她<strong>越</strong>看渔民们捕鱼<strong>越</strong>不愿意离开。</span> Tā <strong>yuè</strong> kàn yúmín men bǔyú <strong>yuè</strong> bù yuànyì líkāi. (<strong>The more</strong> she watched the fishermen catch fish, <strong>the more</strong> she was reluctant to leave.)</p>

<p><span lang="zh-Hans">他离工厂<strong>越</strong>近<strong>越</strong>不想去上班。</span> Tā lí gōngchǎng <strong>yuè</strong> jìn <strong>yuè</strong> bùxiǎng qù shàngbān. (<strong>The closer</strong> he was to the factory, <strong>the more</strong> he didn't want to go to work.)</p>
