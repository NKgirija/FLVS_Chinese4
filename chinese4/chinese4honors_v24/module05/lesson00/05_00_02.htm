					<li>Chinese riddles are called <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">谜语</span> míyǔ</strong>. </li>
						 <li>Chinese riddles are commonly created as a form of entertainment activity during Chinese traditional festivals, such as the Moon festival and the Lantern festival, and its roots date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–CE 25). During such festivals, riddles are written on lanterns and hung up, while people walk around reading and trying to solve them. In this case, Chinese riddles are commonly known as <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">灯谜</span> Dēngmí (Lantern Riddles)</strong>, and trying to solve a lantern riddle is called <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">猜灯谜</span> cāi dēngmí</strong>. Prizes are sometimes given to people who succeed in solving these lantern riddles. </li>
						 <li>The traditional Lantern Festival Riddles aim to challenge participants and assess their familiarity with classical Chinese literature, while common riddles challenge children and adults as well on their knowledge on everyday objects.
						</li>
							<li>Since the people work hard to solve the riddles, another name for the riddles is <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">灯虎</span> Dēnghǔ (Lantern Tigers)</strong>, and trying to solve a riddle is also called <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">射虎</span> shèhǔ</strong> because people put in the effort as hard as hunting a tiger.</li>
							
							<li>A typical Chinese traditional Lantern Riddle consists of three parts: the riddle, the suggestion, and the answer. There is no repetition of a character between the riddle and the answer. </li>
