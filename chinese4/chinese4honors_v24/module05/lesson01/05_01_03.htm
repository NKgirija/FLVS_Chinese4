				<p><span lang="zh-Hans">你好</span>！It's David. Recently in my Chinese class at school, we are learning
					about the Yunnan Province in China. Do you know that to say Yunnan Province in Chinese, it's <a
						class="popover" data-position="top auto" data-title='<span lang="zh-Hans">云南省</span>'
						data-content='<span lang="zh-Hans">云南省</span>  Yúnnán shěng (Yunnan province) <audio controls src="media/ch4_yunnan_province.mp3"></audio>'
						data-html="true" data-trigger="click"><span lang="zh-Hans">云南省</span> Yúnnán shěng</a>? What
					interested me the most is the wildlife in Yunnan. I did my research on the topic, and I was amazed
					at what I had found. Honestly, I have never seen some of the animals that are thriving in the Yunnan
					right now! Let me share my findings. I can't wait to learn more about the wildlife in the region!

						<p>The Yunnan black snub-nosed monkey is an endangered species. The monkeys have grayish,
							black-and-white fur. They can be found in the high-elevation (around nine thousand feet or
							above) mountains in Yunnan and adjacent regions. Its population once dropped to lower than
							one thousand in the 1980s, and by 2022, it had increased to over three thousand eight

		<h3><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h3>
		<p>Let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>
		<div class="tabs mt-3" data-position="left">
			<a class="tab" title="Expressing as long as with 只要 zhǐyào">Expressing "as long as" with "<span
					lang="zh-Hans">只要</span> zhǐyào"</a>

			<div class="panel">
				<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">只要</span> zhǐyào + condition, <span
							lang="zh-Hans">就</span> jiù + result</strong> to express "as long as."</p>

				<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
					will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this <span class="lang"
						data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. Just focus on the grammar points you are learning. </p>

				<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只要</strong>天气变得潮湿，我的膝盖<strong>就</strong>会痛 </span>。<strong>Zhǐyào
					</strong>ānqì biàndé cháoshī, wǒde xīgài <strong>jiù</strong> huì tòng. (My knees will be in pain
					<strong>as long as</strong> the weather continues to be humid.)
				</p>

				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只要</strong>不下雨，我们<strong>就</strong>去公园</span>。<strong>Zhǐyào</strong>
					míngtiān bù xiàyǔ,
					wǒmen <strong>jiù</strong> qù gōngyuán. (We will go to the park <strong>as long as</strong> it
					doesn't rain.)
				</p>

				<p><span
						lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只要</strong>天气暖和起来，你<strong>就</strong>不用穿毛衣了</span>。<strong>Zhìyǎo</strong>
					tiānqì nuǎnnuo qǐlái, nǐ <strong>jiù</strong> bùyòng chuān máoyī le. (You won't have to wear a
					sweater <strong>as long as</strong> the weather starts to get warm.)</p>

			</div>
			<!--End tab #1-->

			<a class="tab" title="Expressing only if with 只有 zhǐyǒu">Expressing "only if" with "<span
					lang="zh-Hans">只有</span> zhǐyǒu"</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">只有</span> zhǐyǒu + condition, <span
							lang="zh-Hans">才</span> cái + result</strong> to express "only if."</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
					will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this <span class="lang"
						data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. Just focus on the grammar points you are learning. </p>

				<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只有</strong>在下雨的时候，人们<span
							lang="zh-Hans"><strong>才</strong></span>会看到这种动物</span>。<strong>Zhǐyǒu</strong> zài xiàyǔ de
					shíhòu, rénmen <strong>cái</strong> huì kàndào zhèzhǒng dòngwù. (People can see this kind of animal
					<strong>only if</strong> it's raining.)
				</p>

				<p><span
						lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只有</strong>冬天的时候，人们<strong>才</strong>会来这里滑雪</span>。<strong>Zhǐyǒu</strong>
					dōngtiān de shíhòu, rénmen <strong>cái</strong> huì lái zhèlǐ huáxuě. (People come ski here
					<strong>only if</strong> it's winter.)
				</p>

				<p><span
						lang="zh-Hans"><strong>只有</strong>搬到干燥的地方，她的病<strong>才</strong>会好起来</span>。<strong>Zhǐyǒu</strong>
					bāndào gānzào de dìfāng, tāde bǐng <strong>cái</strong> huì hǎo qǐlái. (Her illness can start to get
					better <strong>only if </strong> she moves to a dry place.)
				</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The two structures have an essential difference:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">只要</span> zhǐyào + condition, <span lang="zh-Hans">就</span> jiù +
							result (as long as):</strong> Emphasize the condition that will make the result happen.
						There are other conditions out there that can also make the same result happen. </li>
					<li><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">只有</span> zhǐyǒu + condition, <span lang="zh-Hans">才</span> cái +
							result (only if):</strong> Emphasize the ONLY condition that can make the result happen and
						there's no other alternatives. </li>
				</ol>
