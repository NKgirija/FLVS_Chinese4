				<p><span lang="zh-Hans">嗨</span>！ I am Cathy. This summer my family is going to take a trip to the
					Yunnan Province in China. This is exciting! To prepare for the trip, I started to research the
					region on its geography, climate, ecosystem, and culture. Do you know the province's name <span
						lang="zh-Hans">云南</span> Yúnnán (Yunnan) means "<span lang="zh-Hans">彩云之南</span> Cǎiyúnzhīnán
					(South of Colorful Clouds)," referring to its beautiful landscape and amicable climate? What an
					elegant and poetic name! Let me share with you some information I've researched for the region.
					Enjoy! </p>

		<h2><span lang="zh-Hans">语法时间</span> Grammar Time</h2>
		<p>Now let’s look at some grammar structures that you can use for this lesson.</p>

		<div class="fev_grammer_div">

			<h3>Expressing "even if…still" with "<span lang="zh-Hans">即使</span> jíshǐ"</h3>

			<p>You can use the structure <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">即使</span> jíshǐ + situation, <span
						lang="zh-Hans">也</span>
					yě + action</strong> to express "even if…still."</p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may see some unfamiliar words in the example sentences. Remember that you
				will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on these words in this lesson. Just focus on the grammar
				points you are
				learning. </p>
			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>即使</strong>今天很热，他们<strong>也</strong>要在室外打篮球</span>。<strong>Jíshǐ</strong>
				jīntiān hěn rè, tāmen <strong>yě</strong> yào zài shìwài dǎ lánqiú. (<strong>Even if</strong> it's hot
				today, they will <strong>still</strong> play basketball outdoors.)</p>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>即使</strong>这个城市的天气很干燥，我<strong>也</strong>要搬去那里</span>。<strong>Jíshǐ</strong>
				zhègè chéngshì de tiānqì hěn gānzào, wǒ <strong>yě</strong> yào bānqù nàlǐ. (<strong>Even if</strong>
				the weather in this city is very dry, I will <strong>still</strong> move there.)</p>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>即使</strong>我们说不同的语言，我<strong>也</strong>能理解她的感受</span>。<strong>Jíshǐ</strong>
				wǒmen shuō bùtóng de yǔyán, wǒ <strong>yě</strong> néng lǐjiě tāde gǎnshòu. (<strong>Even if</strong> we
				speak different languages, I can <strong>still</strong> understand how she feels.)
			</p>
